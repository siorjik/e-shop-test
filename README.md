This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## About functionality:

This is a simple MVP app like e-commerse.

There is a core functionality:
- two identical pages with menu navigation
- the page about each product info
- the cart page with a calculating logic like update amount, delete, etc
- information about the total sum
- the green button about payment at the bottom of the cart page can be a redirect to the payment page with delivery and other conditions, I didn't do anything with it just created
- remote API fetching for product list works with 'next js' server fetching
- a product amount updates in the cart icon in the header
